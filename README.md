This repository is based on the bonus assignment that I completed for the coursework of "Computer Science for Mechanical Engineers II", offered by DSME RWTH Aachen, headed by Prof. Trimpe. 

Check out the pdf for the tasks involved for the successful completion of the assignment named as "bp_assignment_2_v1.0.0.pdf."
